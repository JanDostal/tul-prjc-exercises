# Description

- These are individual exercises that I have been working on independently in the university course related to C and C++ programming languages at the Technical University in Liberec
- The exercises mainly focus on C language, specifically its concepts (pointers, memory management, working with structs, statically vs dynamically allocated memory etc.) and basic programming constructs (loops, conditions etc.)
- The exercises also only briefly focus on C++ language, specifically its syntax (classes and its constructors, methods, attributes etc.) and OOP principles (polymorphism, composition etc.)
- The exercises were submitted to E-learning, which is provided by TUL

# Info about work process regarding exercises

- Exercises were uploaded sequentially to this repository from E-learning
